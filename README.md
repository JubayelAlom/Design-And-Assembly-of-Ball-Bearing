# ⚙️ Standard Ball Bearing – SolidWorks Practice Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on recreating a **standard deep groove ball bearing** in SolidWorks as part of refining my 3D modeling and parametric design skills.

Although a ball bearing may appear to be a simple mechanical component, accurately modeling it requires careful attention to:

- Dimensional accuracy  
- Geometric symmetry  
- Proper tolerances  
- Cage (retainer) design  
- Parametric relationships  

This exercise helped strengthen my precision modeling workflow and reinforced the importance of fundamental mechanical components in engineering systems.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Improve precision in part modeling  
- Practice circular patterns and symmetry control  
- Develop parametric dimensioning strategies  
- Model realistic cage geometry  
- Understand bearing component relationships

## 🛠️ Components Modeled

The assembly includes:

- Inner Ring  
- Outer Ring  
- Rolling Elements (Balls)  
- Cage / Retainer  

Each component was modeled separately and assembled with proper concentric and coincident mates to replicate realistic bearing construction.
